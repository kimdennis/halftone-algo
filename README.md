# Halftone Circle Graphics Renderer

The **Halftone Circle Graphics Renderer** is an interactive real-time application built using OpenGL. It generates and displays halftone circle patterns, allowing users to manipulate dot size, spacing, and color intensity to create dynamic halftone effects similar to comic book styles, like the iconic Spiderverse art style.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust dot size, spacing, and intensity in real-time.
- **Dynamic Halftone Effects**: Generate halftone circle patterns that vary based on image brightness.
- **Multi-Color Support**: Apply halftone patterns to individual color channels (RGB/CMYK).
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Powered by OpenGL for efficient, real-time rendering.
- **Customization**: Tweak parameters to create your unique halftone designs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- **OpenGL** and **GLFW** libraries
- **GLM** for math operations
- **CMake** (for build configuration)
- **STB Image**: Used for image loading and writing (included)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/halftone-circle-renderer.git
   cd halftone-circle-renderer
